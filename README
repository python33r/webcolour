**webcolour** offers some simple tools for checking the accessibility
of web colours.  It provides functions to parse web colours expressed in
a hexadecimal format, compute the contrast ratio between two colours
and determine the level of WCAG 2.0 conformance.

The WCAG 2.0 Luminosity Contrast Ratio algorithm is used; for more
details, see Guideline 1.4.3 and the glossary definitions of contrast
ratio & relative luminance in the WCAG 2.0 document,
http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG-20081211/.
